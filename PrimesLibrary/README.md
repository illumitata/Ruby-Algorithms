## Why primality test?
What is a primality test? According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test):
> A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime.

Ok... but why we have to find this type of things?
Here is a list of things that heavily relise on those numbers:
* Cryptography
* Security systems
* Coding TV signals
* Hash codes
* Life of cicadas (very interesting topic)
* and list goes on...

## Rspec
To run rspec test for PrimesLibrary, just type in command line:
```
rspec
```
**Make sure you are in PrimesLibrary folder!**

## Algorithms

### Testing primality
To test the primality of given number I choose to implement three algorithms:

#### Naive Method

#### Fermat Primality Test

#### Miller-Rabin Primality Test

### Generating prime numbers
There is also a class for generating these numbers. Used algorithms:

#### Eratosthenes Sieve
